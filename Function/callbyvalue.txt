 // important Note 

 java have always call by value pass in the another function that have passes the arguments.
     java have always call by value..

        // java always call by value means always do copy of the value not change in the original value.
        // that means we pass the a and b in the swapNumber so that it chnages in the a and b that function does change in the main function of a and b;
        // here is the stack frame have original value same and stack frame of swapNumber function have omitted when is is return so all the variables have been deleted.
        // So does not change in another function of the variable it will remains same.



In Java there are two methods 
user defined --> like we have define the function like factorial ,sum,multiply

Inbuilt method -->Math  -->pow ,sqrt,max
         

function Overloading
Multiple functions with the same name but different parameters.

multiply(int a,int b)
multiply(float,float b)
multiply(double a, double b)
