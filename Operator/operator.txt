Operators in Java
Symbols that tell compiler to perform som operation

sum = a + b
Here a and b is operands and + sign is operators (symbols) + - * /

Types of operators

Arithmetic Operators(Binary/Unary)
Relational Operators
Logical Operators
Bitwise Operators (Bit manipulation)
Assignment Operators 

Binary 2 operands
+ addition
- sub
*
/  divide 
% remainder modulo operator

Unary
++  increment
--  decrement

Pre increment                      Post Increment
++a                                    a++
1. Value Change
2. Value use

int a = 10;
int b = ++a;
System.out.println(a);
System.out.println(b);


 // Relational Operator
   ==
   !=
   >
   <
   >=
   <=

 Logical Operator
 && (Logical AND)  
 || (Logical OR)
  ! (Logical NOT)  true->false  !(stt1)
                   false->true

Assignment Operator
  =         A = B
 +=        A = A+10   A+=10
 -=
 *=
 /=
